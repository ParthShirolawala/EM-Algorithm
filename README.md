# EM-Algorithm
1)For running the project make sure to keep the EM.py and em_data.txt in the same folder.

In command prompt change the path to folder in which you saved.
Run the EM.py file.

For example in my case:
After setting the path use command "Python3 EM.py"

2) If in case there's some trouble in running the file from command prompt try to put the folder where python is installed.

Alternative is to run the code in any IDE. I personally use spyder(Python 3.6) IDE to implement the above code.
